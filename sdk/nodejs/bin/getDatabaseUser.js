 * `mongodbatlas..DatabaseUser` describe a Database User. This represents a database user which will be applied to all clusters within the project.
 *
 * Each user has a set of roles that provide access to the projectâ€™s databases. User's roles apply to all the clusters in the project: if two clusters have a `products` database and a user has a role granting `read` access on the products database, the user has that access on both clusters.
